During char creation, if you have Legion, you will have the option of making either a normal level 1 character, or a L100 trial char. If you make a L100 trial char then when you load up the game using that character you will be placed in a scenario where you'll hit a target dummy for a bit to learn your skills, then do the Legion Broken Shore scenario. After the scenario, you will proceed through Legion content like normal up until acquiring your first Artifact Weapon and then you will be locked out from playing that character until you either use a Boost to unlock them and continue from where you left off, or you delete them, or let them rot in your char list.\n-Boosts\nUsing a boost on a trial char to unlock them is only one of the ways to use a boost. You can choose an existing character you have on your account at any level and boost them to 100, and do the same content as a trial character to get you up to speed on all your new abilities. You just won't be locked out after finishing them. As an added bonus, if the character you use the boost on is level 60, your trained primary Professions will be boosted as well.\nIf you are feeling confident in your choice on who to use a boost for, you can use it by itself and select an option to create a new character, rather than use it on an existing character, though in my opinion you are better off at least creating a trial character first, because you then have the option to change your mind before the boost is used up if you find during your first Artifact Quest you don't like the rotation or something.```"

Blizzard adjusts prices on the AH approximately hourly based on current supply and demand.\n\nNA tokens are cheapest cuz Americans are lazy and want to buy their gold, so there are many tokens available. EU tokens are slightly more expensive, and Asia tokens are significantly more expensive.\n\nCheck this URL for up to date pricing for your region: http://wowtoken.info"
